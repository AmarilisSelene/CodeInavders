<h2>ABOUT THE GAME</h2>
<p>Code Invaders is a simple 2D game built in HTML, CSS, canvas and JavaScript, where you have to make Grace Hooper dodge all the bugs.</br>Grace Murray Hopper was a pioneer of computer programming and while she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay.
The moth impeded the operation of the relay, while neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase "debugging" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal "debugging". For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering.</br>This game is a tribute to Grace Hooper and all the women who made history in computing.
